When I see something bad in people,
I've been trying to believe for a long time,
That it's probably fake,
That it was an accident. And I'm wrong.

And, looking for confirmation of similar thoughts,
I strive to believe, forgetting about the reproach,
That a liar, maybe just a big fantasist,
And the boor, he's probably so embarrassed.

That the gossip who stepped on my doorstep,
Perhaps he foolishly talked too much,
And a friend who once didn't help in trouble,
I didn't betray him, but I just got confused then.

I'm not hiding from trouble under my wing at all.
Other measures should be used here.
I really don't want to believe in evil,
And I don't want to believe in meanness terribly!
